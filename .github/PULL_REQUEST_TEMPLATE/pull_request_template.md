### Files Modified

<!-- Highlight important files and explain what changed in each -->

## Quality Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] My code follows Lua coding standards (2 spaces, snake_case, double quotes)
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my extraction logic
- [ ] I have commented complex extraction/validation functions and Factorio-specific handling
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate for data extraction failures

### Data Extraction Testing

- [ ] I have tested extraction with vanilla Factorio installation
- [ ] Extracted data validates against expected schemas
- [ ] Output format is correct (Lua tables/locale .cfg files)
- [ ] No data loss or corruption in the extraction process

### Documentation

- [ ] Updated documentation if new features or requirements added
- [ ] Added inline documentation for complex extraction/validation functions
- [ ] Examples provided for new capabilities

## Testing Details

### Test Environment

<!-- Describe how you tested these changes -->

- **Operating System**: [e.g., Windows 11, Ubuntu 24.04]
- **Factorio Version**: [e.g., 2.0.66]
- **Lua Version**: [e.g., 5.2.4]

### Extraction Test Results

- [ ] All entity types extracted successfully
- [ ] Data validation passes
- [ ] Output format correct

## Factorio-Specific Considerations

### Version Compatibility

- [ ] This change maintains compatibility with supported Factorio versions
- [ ] Any version-specific code is properly documented
