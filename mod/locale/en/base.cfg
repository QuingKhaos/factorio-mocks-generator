factorio-mocks-generator-enable-stable-split=Enable Stable File Splitting

[mod-setting-description]
factorio-mocks-generator-enable-stable-split=When enabled, splits large data categories (recipes, assembling machines, items, etc.) into multiple files with fixed alphabetical ranges. This prevents individual files from becoming too large for Git repositories and editors, but creates more complex directory structures. Recommended for large modpacks like Pyanodons. When disabled, each category is saved as a single file (simpler structure, but may create very large files with complex modpacks).
